## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to generate descriptive visualizations of citibike rideshare userdata so as to drive informed business decisions when creating a rideshare service.

## Results

Below are static images of our visualizations, the interactive versions of which may be found at the link above

Through these visualizations, there are a number of clear, identifiable trends.

1. A large portion of citibike users do so to take trips during commute hours
2. The overwhelming majority of users take trips under 20 minutes
3. The majority of riders are male
4. Much higher ridership is achieved during the week, with numbers dropping during weekends
5. Women do not appear to have signigifcant ridership variance across weekdays or times

From these major trends, we can conclude that the overwhelming bulk of riders are men commmuting to and from work during weekdays, typically centered around the 7-9am and 4-6pm timeframes.

In order to identify trends in more granularity, two additional visualizations would be extremely useful:
1. Employment status by number of rides taken
2. Distance from home to work by number of rides taken

These would further enhance our ability to cater to the most profitable and efficient demographic. 

From the aggregate analysis, we can conclude that our service should provide bikes that appeal to working age males, and that we should seek to concentrate them in areas no further than 20 minutes from bulk residential zoning.
